# Headbutt Combat Robot
In the spring of 2021, I decided to build a combat robot. Enter Headbutt,
my first attempt at creating a combat robot.

## About Headbutt
- 3lb (Beetleweight) combat robot
- 2wd vertical spinner Robot
- Assymetrical vertical spinner
- UHMW & Plastite chassis
- Garolite top and bottom plates
- Weapon mount: needle roller bearings pressed into a bushing riding on a shoulder bolt
- Brushed planetary gearset drive motors
- 3s 650mAh battery

#### The robot features:
- Assymetric vertical spinner for higher bite
  (one side of the weapon is longer than the other, meaning you get a deeper "bite" on the opponent)
- Wedgelets for the low ground
- 1/2" UHMW chassis (This proved to be WAY overkill, 1/2" its a ridiculously tough material)

### Fights (on youtube!)
- [Fight 1](https://youtu.be/kC-pc0cVocw?t=1101)
- [Fight 2](https://youtu.be/kC-pc0cVocw?t=1585)
- [Fight 3](https://youtu.be/kC-pc0cVocw?t=3255)
- [Fight 4](https://youtu.be/kC-pc0cVocw?t=4509)
- Its clear in the videos, but the robot did not end up exactly like the CAD model.
  Titanium wedges were replaced with UHMW walls { due to weight constraints }, and the robot is black, not white.


# Afterthoughts
Given it was my first time building a combat robot, I was relatively pleased with the outcome.

#### Potential Improvements:
- 3/8" UHMW instead of 1/2" -> This would yield large weight savings, and would still be plenty durable
- Smaller plastite screws -> I used MASSIVE plastite screws which, though durable, were a waste of weight
- Shift CG of robot towards the wheels -> The large weapon mass in the front led to poor traction on the back wheels
- Heavier weapon, more powerful weapon motor -> With the weight savings from the chassis and hardware, I would redistribute
  it into the weapon.
- 4s battery -> the battery capacity was higher than necessary, and going 4s would suffice for a short match
